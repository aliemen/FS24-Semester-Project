# Plot Reproducability

RNG seeding: Note that the program contains an "initial seed", which is used to count and generate a new seed for every realization. Only the initial seed should be set. The current values are the ones used to generate the data in the [data](https://github.com/aliemen/FS24-Semester-Project/tree/main/plot-reproducability/data) folder.
